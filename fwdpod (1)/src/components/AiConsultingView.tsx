const FAQS = [
  { q: 'What is a Fractional Chief AI Officer?', a: 'A Fractional Chief AI Officer (Fractional CAIO) is a senior AI leader who provides strategic AI direction to an organization on a part-time or project basis — without the cost and commitment of a full-time executive hire. A Fractional CAIO owns your AI roadmap, guides technology decisions, manages vendor relationships, and builds internal AI capability. Fwdpod provides Fractional Chief AI Officer services through senior AI practitioners who have built and shipped production AI systems.' },
  { q: 'What is a Virtual Chief AI Officer?', a: 'A Virtual Chief AI Officer is a Fractional Chief AI Officer engagement delivered remotely — providing the same strategic AI leadership, roadmap ownership, and advisory function as an in-house CAIO, but without physical presence requirements. This model suits distributed organizations, startups that are not yet ready for a full-time AI executive, and enterprises that need AI Leadership as a Service during a transformation initiative.' },
  { q: 'What is AI Leadership as a Service?', a: 'AI Leadership as a Service is a model where organizations access senior AI strategic leadership on a subscription or engagement basis — including Fractional Chief AI Officer advisory, AI Capability Center design, roadmap development, and team mentorship. Rather than waiting to hire a full-time AI executive, companies can activate AI leadership immediately through Fwdpod\'s AI Strategy Consulting engagements.' },
  { q: 'What is an AI Capability Center?', a: 'An AI Capability Center (AI CoE) is an internal organizational unit that centralizes AI expertise, tooling standards, governance policies, and reusable infrastructure for an enterprise. Building an AI Capability Center ensures AI development is coordinated, compliant, and scalable across the organization. Fwdpod advises on AI Capability Center design: org structure, hiring profiles, tooling standards, and governance frameworks.' },
  { q: 'What does AI consulting include?', a: 'AI consulting from Fwdpod covers AI strategy, architecture review, vendor selection, readiness assessment, roadmap development, and Fractional AI Team advisory. Unlike general management consulting, our AI Strategy Consultants are practicing engineers who have built the systems they advise on — so recommendations are grounded in production reality.' },
  { q: 'How is Fwdpod AI consulting different from traditional consulting?', a: 'Traditional consulting firms deliver strategy documents. Fwdpod consultants are AI engineers who have built production LLM systems, RAG pipelines, and agentic workflows. Our AI Strategy Consultant engagements are grounded in current technical realities, not theoretical frameworks. This is the core value of AI Leadership as a Service from a builder-first organization.' },
  { q: 'How long does an AI consulting engagement take?', a: 'Focused assessments (readiness audit, architecture review) can be completed in 2–4 weeks. Full AI strategy and roadmap engagements typically take 4–8 weeks. Ongoing Fractional AI Team advisory retainers are available on a monthly basis.' },
  { q: 'Can Fwdpod help us build an internal AI team or Capability Center?', a: 'Yes. We advise on AI org design, hiring profiles, tooling standards, and internal AI governance structures — helping companies build sustainable AI Capability Centers rather than permanent external dependency. This is a core output of our AI Leadership as a Service engagements.' },
  { q: 'Does Fwdpod offer ongoing AI advisory retainers?', a: 'Yes. Following a consulting engagement, we offer monthly Fractional AI Team advisory retainers that include architecture reviews, technical escalation support, model evaluation guidance, and quarterly roadmap checkpoints as your AI systems evolve.' },

              AI consulting is the process of providing strategic guidance on how an organization should invest in, build, and operate artificial intelligence systems. A good AI Strategy Consultant aligns business objectives with technical capabilities — helping leaders make informed decisions on AI architecture, vendors, teams, and roadmap sequencing.
            </p>
            <p>
              The AI landscape moves extraordinarily fast. Model capabilities change quarterly, new frameworks emerge weekly, and the risk of building on the wrong foundation is real. Without experienced Fractional AI Leadership, organizations waste significant capital on AI investments that don't deliver.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fwdpod consultants are practicing AI engineers who have built the systems they advise on. This builder-first approach defines our AI Leadership as a Service model — whether we're acting as your Fractional Chief AI Officer, designing your AI Capability Center, or providing a Virtual Chief AI Officer for a transformation initiative.
